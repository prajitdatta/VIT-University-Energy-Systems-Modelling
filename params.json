Direct or beam radiation is the portion of solar radiation that reaches the surface of earth from the sun without any scattering. Diffuse radiation is created with the scattering of direct and reflected radiation by molecules, aerosols and crystals in the air. Global solar radiation is the sum of direct, diffuse and (ground) reflected solar radiation. Diffuse and reflected radiation during clear weather are less than direct, but become important in cloudy weather, when there is no direct radiation. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProcedure\r\n1.\tFormulate the problem.\r\n2.\tDevelop the algorithm \r\n3.\tWrite the MATLAB coding \r\n4.\tPlot the results using plot option and print the graphs.\r\n\r\nFormulae\r\nHourly global, beam and diffuse radiation under cloudless skies (clear days)\r\nThe global radiation Ig reaching a horizontal surface on the earth is given by\r\n\t\tIg = Ib + Id\r\nwhere Ig = hourly global radiation\r\n\tIb = hourly beam radiation\r\n\tId = hourly diffuse radiation\r\nNow, Ib = Ibn cos θz , \r\nwhere\r\nIbn = beam radiation in the direction of the rays, and\r\nθz = angle of incidence on a horizontal surface, i.e. the zenith angle. Thus \r\nIg = Ibn cos θz + Id\r\n\r\nIn the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers) model, it is postulated that \r\n\t and\r\nId = C I¬bn\r\nWhere A, B and C are constants whose values have been determined on a month wise basis. These constants change during the year because of seasonal changes in the dust and water vapor content of the atmosphere, and also because of the changing earth-sun distance. \r\nFrom sun-earth relationship,\r\nCosθz = Sinφ Sinδ + Cosφ Cosδ Cosω\r\nDeclination,   \r\nwhere n is the day number since January 1\r\nHour angle, ω = 15 (solar time - 12) (in degrees)\r\nSolar time = Watch Time - 4 (Lst – Llo) + EoT (in minutes) \r\nEoT = 9.87 sin 2B - 7.53 cos B - 1.5 sin B \r\nwhere,   \r\nTable Values of constants, A, B and C obtained for predicting hourly solar radiation in India\r\n \r\n[Download code here](https://github.com/prajitdatta/VIT-University-Energy-Systems-Modelling/blob/master/solar-radiation-estimation.m)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
