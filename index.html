<p>To estimate and plot the local solar radiation on daily basis using MATLAB coding</p>

<p>Since measurements of solar radiation are often not available, attempts have been made by many investigators to establish relationships linking the values of radiation (global or diffuse) with meteorological parameters like number of sunshine hours, cloud cover, and precipitation.
The visible channel is in the region of the electromagnetic spectrum where the sun emits most of its energy. Direct or beam radiation is the portion of solar radiation that reaches the surface of earth from the sun without any scattering. Diffuse radiation is created with the scattering of direct and reflected radiation by molecules, aerosols and crystals in the air. Global solar radiation is the sum of direct, diffuse and (ground) reflected solar radiation. Diffuse and reflected radiation during clear weather are less than direct, but become important in cloudy weather, when there is no direct radiation. </p>

<p>Procedure
1.  Formulate the problem.
2.  Develop the algorithm 
3.  Write the MATLAB coding 
4.  Plot the results using plot option and print the graphs.</p>

<p>Formulae
Hourly global, beam and diffuse radiation under cloudless skies (clear days)
The global radiation Ig reaching a horizontal surface on the earth is given by
        Ig = Ib + Id
where Ig = hourly global radiation
    Ib = hourly beam radiation
    Id = hourly diffuse radiation
Now, Ib = Ibn cos θz , 
where
Ibn = beam radiation in the direction of the rays, and
θz = angle of incidence on a horizontal surface, i.e. the zenith angle. Thus 
Ig = Ibn cos θz + Id</p>

<p>In the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers) model, it is postulated that 
     and
Id = C I¬bn
Where A, B and C are constants whose values have been determined on a month wise basis. These constants change during the year because of seasonal changes in the dust and water vapor content of the atmosphere, and also because of the changing earth-sun distance. 
From sun-earth relationship,
Cosθz = Sinφ Sinδ + Cosφ Cosδ Cosω
Declination,<br>
where n is the day number since January 1
Hour angle, ω = 15 (solar time - 12) (in degrees)
Solar time = Watch Time - 4 (Lst – Llo) + EoT (in minutes) 
EoT = 9.87 sin 2B - 7.53 cos B - 1.5 sin B
